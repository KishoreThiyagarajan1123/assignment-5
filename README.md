# GitHub Data Dive

## Project Overview
**GitHub Data Dive** is an open-source analytics project aimed at exploring GitHub repositories related to trending topics in the data world. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from repositories, including key metrics such as stars, forks, programming languages, and creation dates, and present these insights through an interactive web application built using **Streamlit**. By leveraging the **GitHub API**, we analyze repository dynamics and provide a comprehensive overview for developers, organizations, and researchers to make informed decisions on project collaboration, technology adoption, and educational resources.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Python**
- **GitHub API**
- **Pandas**
- **SQL**
- **Streamlit**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Data Visualization**

## Domain
**Open Source Software Analytics**

## Problem Statement
With millions of repositories on GitHub, it can be challenging to identify relevant projects, understand trends, and leverage insights for collaboration or research. This project extracts and analyzes data from GitHub repositories to uncover patterns in repository characteristics, popularity, and technology usage. The application allows users to search for specific topics and visualize data such as stars, forks, languages, and repository activity over time.

## Business Use Cases
1. **Developers** can find trending repositories for collaboration or inspiration.
2. **Organizations** can analyze repository popularity and activity related to their technologies.
3. **Educators and Researchers** can explore repositories for teaching materials or academic study.

## Project Approach
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Utilizes the **GitHub API** to fetch repository data based on trending topics in the data world (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, etc.).
   - Key data fields include repository name, owner, description, URL, programming language, creation date, number of stars, forks, and open issues.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Saves the cleaned data into a **MySQL** database for efficient access and querying.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzes repository trends such as popular programming languages, repository activity over time, and key project metrics.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Builds an interactive **Streamlit** app to display insights visually. The app allows users to filter repositories by topic, language, and activity level.

6. **Deployment**:
   - The Streamlit app is deployed for easy public access and scalability.

## Features of the Application
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for repositories by topic.
- **Data Table Display**: A table of repositories is displayed with key information.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - **Stars vs Forks**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between stars and forks.
  - **Programming Language Distribution**: A pie chart showing the distribution of programming languages.
  - **Repository Creation Dates**: A bar chart showing the number of repositories created over time.
- **Database Integration**: Saves the data into a **MySQL** database for future access.
